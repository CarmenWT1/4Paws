      <h3>Our Policy</h3>

      <p>We rescue animals of all types, some waiting destruction in Welsh Pounds, others handed in to us for whatever reason, good or bad.

      We provide medical care, food, shelter and love for them all and ultimately find them loving homes. If for any reason, things do not work out, we always take them back.

      We inoculate and worm all our animals and ensure they receive any medical treatment they may require.

      We also neuter as many of our animals as possible, new owners of any un-neutered animals are bound by agreement to carry out this vital task at the earliest opportunity.

      Every eligible dog, cat or rabbit leaves our Rescue Centre with 4 weeks free insurance from a leading company, new owners are then given the opportunity to extend such cover by subscribing to the scheme.

      Our staff are always available to advise on training or behavioural issues, and are there to assist if needed.- Column content goes here></p>

      <h3>Our Services</h3>
      <p>Our veterinary surgeon checks, worms and inoculates all animals, and implements our rigorous neutering policy, as we strongly believe this makes a happier pet and is the most important step in reducing the escalating problem of pet overpopulation. We also indenti-chip all our dogs and cats.

      We have a non-destruction policy, except on humane grounds, and carry out individual home checks before any animal is placed in a new home, along with follow up visits to ensure the animal has settled.

      Our adopters sign a legal document declaring to give the best possible care, and to ensure the animal is neutered at the earliest opportunity if this has not already been carried out, we always prefer to home animals to households where existing pets are neutered.

      We always take back any former resident if the adopter is unable to keep it, thus ensuring future security for any animal entering Last Chance.</p>
